### README.md

A `README.md` file has been created to provide a concise and welcoming entry point to the project. It outlines the essential features and directs users to the comprehensive documentation for detailed setup and technical information. This approach ensures that new users can quickly understand the project's purpose while developers have a clear path to in-depth resources.

### Comprehensive Documentation

A new, detailed `documentation.md` file has been generated by consolidating and streamlining the previous `README.md` and `documentation.md`. This central document now serves as the single source of truth, offering a logical flow from a high-level overview to technical specifics. It includes expanded sections on installation, architecture, key modules, and deployment, ensuring all necessary information is organized and easily accessible.
