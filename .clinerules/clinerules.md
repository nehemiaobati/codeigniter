# CodeIgniter 4 Development & Deployment Rules

This document outlines the mandatory architectural standards, security mandates, and development workflow for this CodeIgniter 4 application. Adherence to these rules is required to ensure a maintainable, secure, and high-performance codebase.

---

## Part 1: Architectural & Naming Conventions

All code must strictly adhere to the CodeIgniter 4 architecture and the following conventions to maintain consistency and predictability across the application.

### 1.1. File Naming Conventions

- **Controllers:** `PascalCaseController.php` (e.g., `UserController.php`). Exception: `BaseController.php`.
- **Models:** `PascalCaseModel.php` (e.g., `UserModel.php`).
- **Entities:** `PascalCase.php` (e.g., `User.php`).
- **Libraries/Services:** `PascalCaseService.php` (e.g., `PaymentService.php`).
- **Views:** Grouped in a `lowercase` subdirectory named after the controller. File names must be `snake_case.php` (e.g., `app/Views/user/profile_view.php`).
- **Migrations & Seeds:** Use the timestamp-prefixed, `PascalCase` format generated by `php spark`.

### 1.2. Component-Specific Rules

- **Controllers (`app/Controllers/`):**
    - **Role:** Orchestrate application flow.
    - Keep controllers lean, focused on processing HTTP requests and returning responses.
    - Delegate all business logic to Models or Libraries/Services.

- **Models (`app/Models/`):**
    - **Role:** Manage all database interactions.
    - Use Models, the Query Builder, or Entities for data access.
    - Never place direct database queries in Controllers.
    - Import models via `use` and instantiate with their short class name (e.g., `new UserModel()`).

- **Views (`app/Views/`):**
    - **Role:** Handle presentation logic only.
    - Avoid complex PHP logic; focus on displaying data.
    - Escape all dynamic data with `esc()` to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    - Use View Layouts for page structure and View Cells for reusable components.

- **Routing (`app/Config/Routes.php`):**
    - **Role:** Define the application's URL structure.
    - All routes must be explicitly defined and named using the `['as' => 'route.name']` option for stable URL generation.
    - Use `url_to('route.name')` in Views and `redirect()->to(url_to('route.name'))` in Controllers. Do not use hardcoded URL paths.

- **Database (`app/Database/`):**
    - **Role:** Define and manage the database schema and initial data.
    - All schema changes must be managed via Migrations.
    - Initial or test data should be handled by Seeders.

- **Libraries/Services (`app/Libraries/`, `app/Config/Services.php`):**
    - **Role:** House reusable, high-level application logic.
    - Register classes as Services in `app/Config/Services.php` to ensure they are easily testable and managed by the framework.

### 1.3. Dynamic Responses & Flash Messaging

This pattern (Post/Redirect/Get) is mandatory for all form submissions to prevent duplicate submissions on page refresh.

1.  **Controller Actions:**
    - Action methods (e.g., `create()`, `generate()`) must process the request, then store all response data (status messages, results) in the session via `session()->setFlashdata()` or a redirect's `with()` method.
    - Conclude by redirecting, typically using `return redirect()->back()->withInput()`. **Directly rendering a view from a POST action is forbidden.**

2.  **View Display:**
    - The controller method displaying the view (e.g., `index()`) must retrieve all flash data from the session and pass it to the view.
    - Status messages (`success`, `error`, etc.) must be rendered exclusively through the `app/Views/partials/flash_messages.php` partial.
    - The primary `result` of an action is rendered in the main content area of the specific view.

3.  **Standardized Flashdata Keys:**
    - Use these keys for consistency: `success`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `errors`, `result`.

## Part 2: Coding, Security, & Performance

This section defines the standards for code quality, security hardening, and application performance.

### 2.1. Code Standards
- **PSR-12 Compliance:** All PHP code must adhere to the **PSR-12** coding standard.
- **Modern PHP:** Use modern language features, including strict types (`declare(strict_types=1);`), typed properties, and return type declarations.
- **Framework First:** Prioritize built-in CodeIgniter functions and libraries over custom implementations.
- **API Standardization:** Use CodeIgniterâ€™s `API Response Trait` for standardizing all API endpoint responses.

### 2.2. Documentation & Commenting Standards
- **PHPDoc Standard:** All classes, methods, and properties must be documented using PHPDoc syntax.
- **Class DocBlocks:** Ensure each class has a PHPDoc block that briefly describes its purpose.
- **Method DocBlocks:** Every public method must have a PHPDoc block that includes:
    - A concise one-line summary of what the method does.
    - `@param` tags for all parameters, specifying their type and a clear description.
    - A `@return` tag specifying the exact return type and a description of the returned value.
    - A `@throws` tag for any exceptions the method might throw.
- **Property DocBlocks:** Add `@var` PHPDoc tags to describe class properties.
- **Clarity and Precision:** Comments must be direct and specific. Remove any placeholder, redundant, or conversational comments.

### 2.3. Security Mandates
- **CSRF Protection:** Must be enabled globally to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Must be enabled and configured to mitigate injection attacks.
- **Database:** Use the Query Builder or prepared statements for all queries to prevent SQL injection. Raw queries are forbidden.
- **Validation:** Validate all user-provided data (`$GET`, `$POST`, etc.) with the Validation library before processing.
- **Output Escaping:** Escape all data rendered in HTML with `esc()` to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Secure Cookies & Sessions:** In production, set `cookie.secure` and `cookie.httponly` to `true`. Store session data in a database for improved security.
- **Throttler:** Enable on authentication, password reset, and other sensitive routes to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 2.4. Performance Optimization
- **Disable Auto-Routing:** Set `$autoRoute = false` if all routes are explicitly defined, avoiding unnecessary file system scans.
- **Caching:** Enable and configure a production-ready caching driver (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.
- **Optimization Command:** Use `php spark optimize` in the deployment script to build a cached version of the autoloader and configuration.
- **Efficient Queries:** Optimize database queries by selecting only necessary columns and using pagination instead of `findAll()` for large datasets.

### 2.5. Error Handling & Logging
- **Production Error Display:** Disable detailed error reporting to the browser in production (`display_errors = 0`).
- **Exception Logging:** Enable exception logging by setting `$log = true` in `app/Config/Exceptions.php`.
- **Log Level:** Set the production logging threshold to an appropriate level (e.g., 4 for runtime errors) in `app/Config/Logger.php`.
- **Dependency Checks:** When a feature requires a specific PHP extension (e.g., `bcmath`), programmatically check if it's loaded with `extension_loaded()` and log a descriptive error if it's missing.

## Part 3: Deployment & Environment

These rules govern the configuration and deployment of the application to a live server.

### 3.1. Environment Configuration (`.env`)
- **Production Mode:** Set `CI_ENVIRONMENT` to `production`.
- **Protect Credentials:** The production `.env` file must never be committed to version control. Use a template (`env`) for guidance.
- **Centralized Variables:** Define all environment-specific variables (database credentials, API keys) in `.env` and access them via `env()`.
- **Base URL:** Always set `app.baseURL` with a trailing slash (e.g., `https://example.com/`).

### 3.2. Web Server & Filesystem
- **Public Document Root:** The web server's document root must point to the project's `/public` directory. This is a critical security measure to prevent direct web access to application source code.
- **Directory Permissions:** The `app`, `system`, and `writable` directories must reside outside the web-accessible document root. The web server user requires write permissions only on the `writable` directory.
- **Clean Production Server:** Remove development-only files and directories (`tests/`, `phpunit.xml.dist`, `spark`) from the production server.

### 3.3. Dependency Management
- **Production Dependencies:** Before deployment, run `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader` to install only production dependencies and create an optimized class map.

## Part 4: AI Agent Workflow

This section provides a strict protocol for any AI agent modifying the codebase.

1.  **Analyze Request:** Deconstruct user requests into logical, sequential file modifications that align with these rules.
2.  **Propose Changes:** Verbally state the intended modifications and list all affected files before generating code.
3.  **Adhere to Rules:** All modifications must respect every principle outlined in this document without exception.
4.  **File Generation:** Use `php spark make:*` commands to generate new boilerplate files (Controllers, Models, etc.). Manual creation is forbidden. Do not alter the structure of generated boilerplate.
5.  **File Modification:** When updating a file, specify its full path from the project root and provide the complete, updated file content. Partial code snippets are not acceptable.
6.  **Final Confirmation:** Confirm that all changes have been applied in accordance with these rules before concluding the task.
